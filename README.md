# supermarket-app
the final test for the sprints X microsoft app development course
Supermarcket App
This project is a Flutter application designed to simulate a basic online supermarket experience. It allows users to navigate through product listings and view "hot offers." The application focuses on demonstrating fundamental Flutter UI/UX principles and navigation.

Features
User Authentication (Mocked): Provides sign-up and sign-in screens. For the purpose of this course project, the authentication logic is mocked, and successful validation directly navigates to the shopping screen without real Firebase integration.

Product Listing: Displays a grid of various supermarket products with their names, prices, and images.

Hot Offers Section: Showcases special offers in a scrollable list.

Add to Cart Simulation: Tapping the cart icon on a product card shows a temporary "added to cart" message (via SnackBar).

Responsive UI: Designed to adapt to different screen sizes.

Navigation: Implements routing between different screens (Home, Sign Up, Sign In, Shopping).
